## 🤖 Claude Code

Agents and skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (Anthropic's AI coding CLI).

### Agents

Specialist roles with deep domain knowledge. You can request a specific agent by name in your prompt (e.g., *"use the qa-specialist to write tests for this module"*). Claude Code also selects agents automatically when spawning subagents via the Task tool.

| Agent                  | Purpose                          | Key Capabilities                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **sw-engineer**        | Architecture and implementation  | SOLID principles, type safety, clean architecture, doctest-driven dev           |
| **solution-architect** | System design and API planning   | ADRs, interface specs, migration plans, coupling analysis, API surface audit    |
| **oss-maintainer**     | Project lifecycle management     | Issue triage, PR review, SemVer, pyDeprecate, trusted publishing                |
| **ai-researcher**      | ML research and implementation   | Paper analysis, experiment design, LLM evaluation, inference optimization       |
| **qa-specialist**      | Testing and validation           | pytest, hypothesis, mutation testing, snapshot tests, ML test patterns          |
| **linting-expert**     | Code quality and static analysis | ruff, mypy, pre-commit, rule selection strategy, CI quality gates               |
| **perf-optimizer**     | Performance engineering          | Profile-first workflow, CPU/GPU/memory/I/O, torch.compile, mixed precision      |

| **web-explorer**       | Web and docs research            | API version comparison, migration guides, PyPI tracking, ecosystem compat       |
| **self-mentor**        | Config quality reviewer (Opus)   | Agent/skill auditing, duplication detection, cross-ref validation, line budgets |

### Skills

Skills are orchestrations of agents — invoked via slash commands (`/review`, `/fix`, etc.). A single skill typically composes multiple agents in parallel and consolidates their output. Think of agents as specialists you can talk to, and skills as predefined workflows that coordinate them.

| Skill         | Command                            | What It Does                                                                                               |

### Status Line

A lightweight hook (`hooks/statusline.js`) adds a persistent status bar to every Claude Code session:

```
claude-sonnet-4-6 │ Borda.local │ Pro ~$1.20 │ ████░░░░░░ 38%
claude-sonnet-4-6 │ Borda.local │ API $0.42  │ ████░░░░░░ 38%
claude-sonnet-4-6 │ Borda.local │ Max ~$0.80 │ ██░░░░░░░░ 20% │ ⚡ 2 agents (Explore, sw-engineer)
```

Shows the active model name, current project directory, billing indicator, a 10-segment context usage bar (green → yellow → red), and an active subagent indicator when background agents are running.

<details>
<summary><strong>Billing indicator explained</strong></summary>

- **Subscription (Pro/Max)**: `Max/Pro/Sub ~$X.XX` in cyan — plan name is inferred from context window size (≥1M tokens → Max, ≥200k → Pro, else Sub); `~$X.XX` is the session's theoretical API-rate cost (tokens × list price), not an actual charge. Use `/status` for real monthly quota.
- **API key**: `API $X.XX` in yellow — actual spend at pay-per-token rates.

`cost.total_cost_usd` (the source of `$X.XX`) is tokens × published API rates. For subscription users this is an estimate only — Anthropic's subscription quota uses internal accounting that doesn't map 1:1 to API list prices.

</details>

The subagent indicator (`⚡ N agents (type, ...)`) appears while Task agents are running and clears the moment they finish. It is powered by a companion hook (`hooks/task-log.js`) that listens to `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` events — agents are added when they spawn and removed when they complete, for both foreground and background tasks. A 10-minute safety-net age-out handles crashed or hung agents.

Configured via `statusLine` in `settings.json`. Zero external dependencies — stdlib `path` and `fs` only.

### Config Sync

This repo is the **source of truth** for all `.claude/` configuration. Home (`~/.claude/`) is a downstream copy kept in sync via the `/sync` skill.

```
Borda.local/.claude/   →   ~/.claude/
  agents/                    agents/
  skills/                    skills/
  hooks/statusline.js        hooks/statusline.js
  settings.json              settings.json  (statusLine path rewritten to absolute)
```

One file is intentionally **not synced**: `settings.local.json` (machine-local overrides). `CLAUDE.md` is synced as part of the standard propagation.

**Workflow:**

```bash
/sync          # dry-run: show drift report (MISSING / DIFFERS / IDENTICAL per file)
/sync apply    # apply: copy all differing files and verify outcome
```

Run `/sync` after editing any agent, skill, hook, or `settings.json` in this repo to propagate the change to the home config.

## 🤖 Codex CLI

Multi-agent configuration for [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (Rust implementation, v0.105+). Where Claude Code excels at long-horizon planning and research, Codex CLI is optimized for focused, in-repo agentic coding — running shell commands, editing files, and spawning parallel sub-agents directly in your terminal.

### Agents

Nine specialist roles wired into the multi-agent system. Codex can spawn them autonomously based on task type (see `AGENTS.md` for the full spawn-rule matrix) or you can address them by name in your prompt.

| Agent                | Model         | Effort | Purpose                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **sw-engineer**      | gpt-5.3-codex | high   | SOLID implementation, doctest-driven dev, ML pipeline architecture      |
| **qa-specialist**    | gpt-5.3-codex | xhigh  | Edge-case matrix, The Borda Standard, adversarial test review           |
| **squeezer**         | gpt-5.3-codex | high   | Profile-first optimization, GPU throughput, memory efficiency           |
| **doc-scribe**       | gpt-5.3-codex | medium | 6-point Google/Napoleon docstrings, README stewardship, CHANGELOG       |
| **security-auditor** | gpt-5.3-codex | xhigh  | OWASP Python, ML supply chain, secrets, CI/CD hygiene *(read-only)*     |
| **data-steward**     | gpt-5.3-codex | high   | Split leakage, DataLoader reproducibility, augmentation correctness     |
| **ci-guardian**      | gpt-5.3-codex | medium | GitHub Actions, trusted PyPI publishing, pre-commit, flaky tests        |
| **linting-expert**   | gpt-5.3-codex | medium | ruff, mypy, pre-commit config, rule progression, suppression discipline |
| **oss-maintainer**   | gpt-5.3-codex | high   | Issue triage, PR review, SemVer, pyDeprecate, release checklist         |

### Model Strategy

All agents use `gpt-5.3-codex` — the current Codex CLI default and the upgrade target for every prior model in the catalog. Differentiation is via reasoning effort:

- **xhigh** — adversarial roles (qa-specialist, security-auditor): exhaustive search for what could go wrong
- **high** — analytical roles (sw-engineer, squeezer, data-steward, oss-maintainer): depth without unbounded budget
- **medium** — writing/config roles (doc-scribe, ci-guardian, linting-expert): quality over deductive intensity

### Usage

```bash
# Interactive session — Codex selects agents automatically
codex

# Address a specific agent by name in your prompt
codex "use the security-auditor to review src/api/auth.py"
codex "spawn data-steward to validate the train/val split in data/splits/"

# Parallel fan-out (Codex orchestrates automatically per AGENTS.md rules)
# e.g. after sw-engineer finishes → qa-specialist + doc-scribe run concurrently
```

### Install / Port to Home

This repo is the authoring location. To activate globally, copy the entire `.codex/` directory to `~/.codex/`:

```bash
cp -r .codex/ ~/.codex/
```

Paths in `config.toml` are **relative** — no substitution needed. The `AGENTS.md` at `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` is read by Codex for every project; a project-local `AGENTS.md` at the repo root extends it.

### Files

| File            | Purpose                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config.toml`   | Global model, sandbox, features flags, and `[agents]` registry            |
| `AGENTS.md`     | Borda Standard, 6-point docstring structure, spawn rules for all 9 agents |
| `agents/*.toml` | Per-agent `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, and `developer_instructions` |

## 💡 Design Principles

- **Agents are roles, skills are workflows** — agents carry domain expertise, skills orchestrate multi-step processes
- **No duplication** — agents reference each other instead of repeating content (e.g., sw-engineer references linting-expert for config)
- **Profile-first, measure-last** — performance skills always bracket changes with measurements
- **Link integrity** — never cite a URL without fetching it first (enforced in all research agents)
- **Python 3.10+ baseline** — all configs target py310 minimum (3.9 EOL was Oct 2025)
- **Modern toolchain** — uv, ruff, mypy, pytest, GitHub Actions with trusted publishing

## 🎯 Tailored For

This setup is optimized for maintaining Python/ML OSS projects in the PyTorch ecosystem:

- Libraries with public APIs requiring SemVer discipline and deprecation cycles
- ML training and inference codebases needing GPU profiling and data pipeline validation
- Multi-contributor projects with CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, and automated releases
